## About Me

I am a passionate and dedicated undergraduate student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Queens College, City University of New York (CUNY), with an expected graduation date of May 2025. I have a solid foundation in computer science principles and practical experience, which I began developing during my Associate of Science in Computer Science at LaGuardia Community College.

**Fun Fact:** When I go fishing, I like to eat the fish, and I have never understood why people send it back to the water.
